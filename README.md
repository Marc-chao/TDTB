envTB
=====

The repository contains the packages I've written in Python
for analysing tight-binding parameters, generated by VASP and wannier90.

There is a lot of program functionality I coded in Mathematica; I will
rewrite it in Python, so stay tuned for updates.

Use
---

You will find the main content in the folder 
[pymodules](https://github.com/zonksoft/envTB/tree/master/pymodules). 
See the file 
[pymodules/simple.py](https://github.com/zonksoft/envTB/blob/master/pymodules/simple.py) 
for use cases and examples. The easiest way to get to know the package is 
to copy code from there, run it line by line and use pydoc or IPython to have 
a look at the classes and the documentation.


Requirements
------------

* Python interpreter: [Windows](http://www.python.org/getit/windows/); probably preinstalled on Linux
* Numpy, Scipy with LAPACK and BLAS: Good performance: 
  [ATLAS](http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/Linux#head-bfec1665faa2c3686b5b56162bb2ddc36c47a9ba) 
  or [Intel MKL](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/numpy-scipy-with-mkl) 
  (get free, non-commercial version [here](http://software.intel.com/en-us/non-commercial-software-development)).
  Easy, but lower performance:`sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy`.
* IPython (optional, but recommended): Download [setup](http://ipython.org/download.html) or install it
  using your package manager (e.g. `sudo apt-get install ipython` in Ubuntu)
