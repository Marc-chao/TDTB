envTB
=====

envTB is a Python package for **env** ironment-dependent **T** ight- **B** inding. Its features include:

* Use Nth-nearest-neighbour approximation
* Use Wannier orbitals/parameters generated by VASP and wannier90
* Solve electrostatic problems using finite differences in 2D
* Calculate quantum capacitance from DOS or LDOS (using tight-binding)
* Apply magnetic field
* Calculate energy spectrum, bandstructures and density of states of crystal cells and supercells (e.g. defects, quantum dots, nanoribbons)
* Mix parameters from different DFT calculations to increase accuracy (e.g. use special parameters around a vacancy or at an edge)

A main advantage is that the package is easily **scriptable** (which lies in the nature of Python). This means that you donâ€™t need input files, because you define **all necessary parameters in a .py file**, and you can easily **use and export any data** that occurs during the calculation, because the data is saved in local variables that you can plot, export and reuse.
